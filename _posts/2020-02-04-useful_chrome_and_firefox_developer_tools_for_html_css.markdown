Are you stuck on what design to make for a webpage? Or did you find a webpage design you really like and want to copy it? As it turns out, one of the most useful tools for detecting and exploring web designs lies built right in to your internet browser.  All you have to do is open a window into the site you like, or the webpage you are building, right click, and hit "Inspect Element" (Firefox) or "Inspect" (Google Chrome). These come built-in with your browser and do not need to be downloaded or added. 

A toolbar should show up at the bottom of your screen, with several tabs at the top including Inspector, Console, Debugger, etc. 

JavaScript users likely already know about the Console tab that shows up, as it is a convenient way to test JavaScript without even having to use an IDE. The first tab, the Inspect Tab (or Elements tab for our Chrome users), allows you to peek in on the HTML structure of a page. If you mouse over parts of the screen, the relevant element is highlighted in the displayed HTML. If you have perhaps seen a webpage's style that you really like, you can see the type of element, classes, layout, and styles all in this first tab. 

Now let's say you're working on building your own webpage, and you have the basic structure down, but not quite the details. And color coordination is simply beyond you. Never fear! Help is on the way. Pull up the page that you are designing in your browser and open up the developer toolbar. To the right of the main body in this first tab is another section: "Styles" (Chrome) or "Pseudo-Elements" (Firefox). It includes a list of applied styles by element, such as font-size, color, margin, padding, etc. You can actually test colors, styles, margins, etc. on the page before you make any changes to your code here. You can check or uncheck classes or CSS already on the page. You can also test new colors by clicking on a particular attribute you want to change, then finding it in the "Styles" or "Pseudo-Elements" section. You can type in a hexcode for a color you want to try out, for example. Fun fact: you can also use this to play around on live websites too. Of course, it only alters the viewing of your copy of the page, and will immediately revert to the original once you leave the browser. Still, it is fun to use! 

Firefox also has a {}Style Editor tab that allows you to see the CSS stylesheets of a webpage. You can use this to further investigate styles that you like or look for ideas (if you, for example, really like the box-shadow on an element and just have to know how to make it yourself!). 

So the next time you are stuck on a page's design, hop into the developer toolbar, and these tools may help you get unstuck.
