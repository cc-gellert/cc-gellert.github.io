This is not to rag on sales, but my last job was sales and soul-crushing for me. There is no experience quite like being the figurehead of a failing ship to make you desperate for a change. I liken it to how mermaids carved into the bows of wooden ships in history must have felt (had they had feelings) when the ship was sinking. "Dammit," they probably thought. "I just can't put a positive spin on this." After over a year of trying to make it work, I started looking for a change. 

I have to be honest, I was very reluctant to look into coding at first. I had no experience in tech. I had always figured myself to be someone more left-brained than right-brained. Unfortunately, when I went through school, there was one Computer class- that's it. And it was basically a free hour in the computer lab that students used to either do homework from other classes or play computer games. It did not appeal to me.

Things continued on much the same way in college. How I wish I had looked more into a Computer Science degree! The job outlook is positive, and who can deny the appeal of being on the frontlines of tech, where the right app or algorithm could be the next gamechanger? Plus it's always satisfying to think of a program, website, or app, and then actually build it yourself. But I didn't think about all that in college. I figured I would just bounce my way through life and find something. Unfortunately, that theory works great in cinema but not in practice. I graduated with a degree that helped me land my first job, which was great, but I worked overtime almost every day and the pay wasn't great. Then I jumped to a new job in a new city. Unfortunately, things did not go so well for me there either. 

Upon the advice of a friend I looked into coding. He suggested that a love of foreign languages might translate well into coding. I tried it out. He was right. I decided to pursue this fulltime. I bounced around freecodecamp, Codecademy, Udemy courses, and YouTube. In the end, i still felt that I was missing something. But I was very gun-shy about taking on more debt. Like many of today's college graduates, I still had student debt from college (for reference, I graduated 3 years ago). I wavered for months, looking at different bootcamps, scouring their fees, job reports, and reviews. I would consider it strongly, then put it away for a different time. Christmas rolled around, and the energy of the upcoming new decade gave me that push that I needed to sign the dotted line at last. 

So here I am now, writing this blog post, trying to make this transition work. My hope is that a year from now I can read this post, smiling, with a mug of tea in my hand at my new workplace, in a new position I love, with supportive coworkers. Then I'll close this out, sigh, and say to myself, "It was worth it. You just have to take that leap of faith first." At least, that's how I picture it. Then the picture fades out and some skippy pop song comes on, just like the end of a Tyler Perry movie. 

Keep your fingers crossed for me!
